## Template portfolio page made by ReactJS

### Things you need to adjust:
- All required information are stored in ```data.json``` in root directory. 
- There are screenshots of the projects defined in this file in ```public/images/projects``` folders.
- To replace photo, you need to keep name of the file the same (```me.png```) in ```public/images/thumbnail``` directory.

Hope you like it ;)
